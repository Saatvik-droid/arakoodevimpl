Identifying and avoiding the preventable risk factors of BC reduces its occurrence effectively. So, this study aimed to assess BC's risk factors and risk perception status in Babol, Northern Iran.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 women aged 18 to 70 in Babol, Northern Iran. According to the eligibility criteria, the selected participants completed the demographic characteristics and researcher-made valid and reliable questionnaires. The statistical software was SPSS20.\nThe significant risk factors related to BC were old age (60 years old and more) (30.2%), obesity (25.8%), history of radiation (10%), and familial history of BC (9.5%), respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Suspected symptoms of BC were observed in 78 (19.5%) women, including indentations in 27 (6.75%), redness in 15 (3.75%), pain in 16 (4%), and enlargement of lymph nodes in 20 (5%). The BC risk perception score was 107.72±13.22.\nMost participants had at least one risk factor for BC. It is essential to implement intervention programs to control obesity and BC screening programs in obese and overweight women to prevent BC and its complications. Further studies are needed.\nBMC women's health\n10.1186/s12905-023-02422-z\n", {'citation_data': "BMC women's health\nFaryabi, Reza\nDaneshi, Salman\nDavarani, Esmat Rezabeigi\nYusefi, Ali Reza\nArabpour, Mahdieh\nEzoji, Khadijeh\nMovahed, Ehsan\nDaneshi-Maskooni, Milad\nHussaini, Seyed Mohammadreza\nBMC women's health\n23\n1\n2023-May-16\n"}), ('BMC health services research\nVenous access devices commonly used in clinical practice for long-term chemotherapy of breast cancer include central venous catheters (CVCs), peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), and implantable venous access ports (IVAPs). CVCs and PICCs are less costly to place but have a higher complication rate than IVAPs. However, there is a lack of cost-utility comparisons among the three devices. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three catheters for long-term chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.\nThis study used propensity score matching (PSM) to establish a retrospective cohort. Decision tree models were used to compare the cost-effectiveness of three different intravenous lines in breast cancer chemotherapy patients. Cost parameters were derived from data extracted from the outpatient and inpatient charging systems, and total costs included costs of placement, maintenance, extraction, and handling of complications; utility parameters were derived from previous cross-sectional survey results of the research group; and complication rates were derived from breast cancer catheterization patient information as well as follow-up information. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured for efficacy outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare the three strategies. To assess uncertainty in model parameters, sensitivity analyses (univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) were performed.\nA total of 10,718 patients (3780 after propensity score matching) were included. IVAPs had the smallest cost-utility ratio, and PICCs had the largest cost-utility ratio when left in place for more than 12 months. The incremental cost-utility ratio of PICC to CVC was $2375.08/QALY, IVAP to PICC was $522.01/QALY, and IVAP to CVC was $612.98/QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that IVAPs were more effective than CVCs and PICCs. Model regression analysis showed that the IVAP was recommended as the best regimen regardless of the catheter indwelling time (6 months, 12 months or more than 12 months). The reliability and stability of the model were verified by single-factor sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation (probabilistic sensitivity analysis).\nThis study provides economic evidence for the selection of vascular access in breast cancer chemotherapy patients. In the case of limited resources in China, establishing a decision tree model comparing the cost-effectiveness of three vascular access devices for breast cancer chemotherapy patients determined that the IVAP was the most cost-effective regimen.\nBMC health services research\n10.1186/s12913-023-09517-1\n', {'citation_data': 'BMC health services research\nChen, Na\nYang, Qing\nLi, Yin Feng\nGuo, Qin\nHuang, De Yu\nPeng, Jia Ling\nBMC health services research\n23\n1\n2023-May-16\n'}), ('Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR\nReference\nJournal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR\n10.1186/s13046-023-02709-x\n', {'citation_data': 'Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR\nReference\nCigliano, Antonio\nZhang, Shanshan\nRibback, Silvia\nSteinmann, Sara\nSini, Marcella\nAment, Cindy E\nUtpatel, Kirsten\nSong, Xinhua\nWang, Jingxiao\nPilo, Maria G\nBerger, Fabian\nWang, Haichuan\nTao, Junyan\nLi, Xiaolei\nPes, Giovanni M\nMancarella, Serena\nGiannelli, Gianluigi\nDombrowski, Frank\nEvert, Matthias\nCalvisi, Diego F\nChen, Xin\nEvert, Katja\nJournal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR\n42\n1\n2023-May-17\n'}), ("Cell division\ncircular RNAs (circRNAs) have been considered novel biomarker candidates for human cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). circ_0001006 was identified as a\xa0differentially expressed circRNA in metastatic breast cancer, but its significance and function in TNBC were unclear.

Therefore, both identifying new drug-target links, as well as delineating the type of drug interaction, are important in drug repurposing studies.\nA computational drug repurposing approach was proposed to predict novel drug-target interactions (DTIs), as well as to predict the type of interaction induced. The methodology is based on mining a heterogeneous graph that integrates drug-drug and protein-protein similarity networks, together with verified drug-disease and protein-disease associations. In order to extract appropriate features, the three-layer heterogeneous graph was mapped to low dimensional vectors using node embedding principles. The DTI prediction problem was formulated as a multi-label, multi-class classification task, aiming to determine drug modes of action. DTIs were defined by concatenating pairs of drug and target vectors extracted from graph embedding, which were used as input to classification via gradient boosted trees, where a model is trained to predict the type of interaction. After validating the prediction ability of DT2Vec+, a comprehensive analysis of all unknown DTIs was conducted to predict the degree and type of interaction. Finally, the model was applied to propose potential approved drugs to target cancer-specific biomarkers.\nDT2Vec+ showed promising results in predicting type of DTI, which was achieved via integrating and mapping triplet drug-target-disease association graphs into low-dimensional dense vectors. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses prediction between drugs and targets across six interaction types.\nBMC bioinformatics\n10.1186/s12859-023-05317-w\n', {'citation_data': 'BMC bioinformatics\nAmiri Souri, E\nChenoweth, A\nKaragiannis, S N\nTsoka, S\nBMC bioinformatics\n24\n1\n2023-May-17\n'})],

You are Tom, Assistant.
Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.
Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies.
If you have completed all your tasks, make sure to use the "finish" command.

Goals:
1.Write brief description on Breast cancer

Constraints:
1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
3. No user assistance
4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"
5. Write to file before researching.
Commands:
1.MYGENE:This is useful for finding information on specific genes, or genes associated with the search query. If you wish to make a task to create an API request to mygene then simply say 'MYGENE:' followed by what you would like to search for. Example: 'MYGENE: look up information on genes that are linked to cancer'API PARAMETERS - query: What is being searched, args json schema: {'query': {'title': 'query', 'type': 'string'}}
2.PUBMED:This is useful for searching biomedical literature and studies on any medical subject.API PARAMETERS - query: What is being searched, args json schema: {'query': {'title': 'query', 'type': 'string'}}
3.write_file:Write file to disk one file at a time, args json schema: {'file_path': {'title': 'File Path', 'description': 'name of file', 'type': 'string'}, 'text': {'title': 'Text', 'description': 'text to write to file', 'type': 'string'}}
4.read_file:Read file from disk, args json schema: {'file_path': {'title': 'File Path', 'description': 'name of file', 'type': 'string'}}
5.finish:Signal that you have finished all your objectives, args json schema: {'response': 'final response to let people know you have finished your objectives'}

Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.
4.Do not repeat same tasks.

With anticancer medications causing severe adverse effects, understanding the role of alternative and efficacious anticancer treatments with minimal or no side effects can be beneficial. Edible mushrooms have been associated with certain health benefits and exhibit a broad range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activities. The anticancer potential of different mushrooms is now being tested. The goal of this scoping review was to discuss the most recent and available evidence on the therapeutic uses of medicinal mushrooms in cancer treatment, specifically those cancers with some of the highest mortality rates (i.e., gastric, breast, and colorectal cancer).\xa0Randomly controlled trials, clinical trials, and retrospective cohort studies (with placebo group) with human subjects published between 2012-2023 were searched using the databases Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), and Alt HealthWatch. The initial search yielded 2,202 articles. After removing 853 duplicate citations, 1,349 articles remained and were screened for study eligibility and accessibility, leaving 26 articles. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were then used to assess the remaining 26 full-text articles and nine articles were selected for the final review.

Recently, breast surgery is believed to improve the survival rates among these women, but due to limited evidence, definite conclusions cannot be made. Therefore, we undertook this narrative review to synthesize the evidence from existing studies to assess the effectiveness of locoregional surgery and surgery of metastatic sites in improving the outcomes among women diagnosed with metastatic cancer disease along with the summary of current treatment guidelines. We reviewed PubMed and Embase and included both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published in English between 2000 and 2021. Outcomes were either survival, quality of life, toxicity related to local treatment assessed by mortality at the end of one month, progression-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival. The main effect size assessed was hazard ratio with their 95% CIs. After literature search, we found 8 observational studies and 3 RCTs. The findings of the observational studies revealed that breast cancer surgery improves survival from 30% to 50% among women. However, findings from RCTs were mixed for local and distant progression survival. Surgery improved the local progression-free survival but worsened the distant progression-free survival. Besides, there was no effect of breast surgery on quality of life. Regarding the surgery of metastatic site, studies are complex with mixed findings and variation in survival depending upon the type of metastatic site and response to initial systematic therapy and other factors. Based on the existing mixed evidence, it is not possible to make firm and definite conclusions about the effectiveness of breast surgery in improving the survival or quality of life among women with metastatic breast cancer. In future, more RCTs are required with a larger sample size to confirm the findings of observational studies.\nBreast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\n10.2147/BCTT.S405864\n', {'citation_data': 'Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\nAlghamdi, Maha Ahmed Alamodi\nEsam Mahmood, Syed\nBreast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\n15\n2023'}), ('European journal of pharmacology\nNifuroxazide (NFX) is a safe nitrofuran antibacterial drug used clinically to treat acute diarrhea and infectious traveler diarrhea or colitis.

Moreover, it has promising effects against sepsis-induced organ injury, hepatic disorders, diabetic nephropathy, ulcerative colitis, and immune disorders. These promising effects appear to be mediated by suppressing STAT3 as well as NF-κB, TLR4, and β-catenin expressions and effectively decreasing downstream cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.

TAMs exhibit protumor functions related to invasion, metastasis, and immunosuppression, and an increased density of TAMs is associated with a poor clinical course in many cancers. Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also known as osteopontin, is a multifunctional secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein. Although SPP1 is produced in a variety of organs, at the cellular level, it is expressed on only a few cell types, such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphoid cells, and mononuclear cells. SPP1 is also expressed by cancer cells, and previous studies have demonstrated correlations between levels of circulating SPP1 and/or increased SPP1 expression on tumor cells and poor prognosis in many types of cancer. We recently revealed that SPP1 expression on TAMs is correlated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in lung adenocarcinoma. In this review, we summarize the significance of TAMs in lung cancers and discuss the importance of SPP1 as a new marker for the protumor subpopulation of monocyte-derived TAMs in lung adenocarcinoma. Several studies have shown that the SPP1/CD44 axis contribute to cancer chemoresistance in solid cancers, so the SPP1/CD44 axis may represent one of the most critical mechanisms for cell-to-cell communication between cancer cells and TAMs.\nCancers\n10.3390/cancers15082250\n', {'citation_data': 'Cancers\nMatsubara, Eri\nYano, Hiromu\nPan, Cheng\nKomohara, Yoshihiro\nFujiwara, Yukio\nZhao, Shukang\nShinchi, Yusuke\nKurotaki, Daisuke\nSuzuki, Makoto\nCancers\n15\n8\n2023-Apr-12\n'}), ('Die Pharmazie\nGlioblastoma is a highly malignant and invasive brain tumor, and there is an urgent need to establish a treatment option that prevents its growth and metastasis.

With anticancer medications causing severe adverse effects, understanding the role of alternative and efficacious anticancer treatments with minimal or no side effects can be beneficial. Edible mushrooms have been associated with certain health benefits and exhibit a broad range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating activities. The anticancer potential of different mushrooms is now being tested. The goal of this scoping review was to discuss the most recent and available evidence on the therapeutic uses of medicinal mushrooms in cancer treatment, specifically those cancers with some of the highest mortality rates (i.e., gastric, breast, and colorectal cancer).\xa0Randomly controlled trials, clinical trials, and retrospective cohort studies (with placebo group) with human subjects published between 2012-2023 were searched using the databases Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), and Alt HealthWatch. The initial search yielded 2,202 articles. After removing 853 duplicate citations, 1,349 articles remained and were screened for study eligibility and accessibility, leaving 26 articles. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were then used to assess the remaining 26 full-text articles and nine articles were selected for the final review. The characteristics of the nine studies reported the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms \nCureus\n10.7759/cureus.37574\n', {'citation_data': 'Cureus\nDan, Amit\nSwain, Robyn\nBelonce, Seigna\nJacobs, Robin J\nCureus\n15\n4\n2023-Apr'}), ('Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\nMetastatic breast cancer is difficult to cure and has a worse prognosis with higher rates of mortality. Recently, breast surgery is believed to improve the survival rates among these women, but due to limited evidence, definite conclusions cannot be made. Therefore, we undertook this narrative review to synthesize the evidence from existing studies to assess the effectiveness of locoregional surgery and surgery of metastatic sites in improving the outcomes among women diagnosed with metastatic cancer disease along with the summary of current treatment guidelines. We reviewed PubMed and Embase and included both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published in English between 2000 and 2021. Outcomes were either survival, quality of life, toxicity related to local treatment assessed by mortality at the end of one month, progression-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival. The main effect size assessed was hazard ratio with their 95% CIs. After literature search, we found 8 observational studies and 3 RCTs. The findings of the observational studies revealed that breast cancer surgery improves survival from 30% to 50% among women. However, findings from RCTs were mixed for local and distant progression survival. Surgery improved the local progression-free survival but worsened the distant progression-free survival. Besides, there was no effect of breast surgery on quality of life. Regarding the surgery of metastatic site, studies are complex with mixed findings and variation in survival depending upon the type of metastatic site and response to initial systematic therapy and other factors. Based on the existing mixed evidence, it is not possible to make firm and definite conclusions about the effectiveness of breast surgery in improving the survival or quality of life among women with metastatic breast cancer. In future, more RCTs are required with a larger sample size to confirm the findings of observational studies.\nBreast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\n10.2147/BCTT.S405864\n', {'citation_data': 'Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\nAlghamdi, Maha Ahmed Alamodi\nEsam Mahmood, Syed\nBreast cancer (Dove Medical Press)\n15\n2023'}), ('European journal of pharmacology\nNifuroxazide (NFX) is a safe nitrofuran antibacterial drug used clinically to treat acute diarrhea and infectious traveler diarrhea or colitis.

NFX has potential roles in inhibiting thyroid, breast, lung, bladder, liver, and colon cancers and osteosarcoma, melanoma, and others mediated by suppressing STAT3 as well as ALDH1, MMP2, MMP9, Bcl2 and upregulating Bax. Moreover, it has promising effects against sepsis-induced organ injury, hepatic disorders, diabetic nephropathy, ulcerative colitis, and immune disorders. These promising effects appear to be mediated by suppressing STAT3 as well as NF-κB, TLR4, and β-catenin expressions and effectively decreasing downstream cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Our review summarizes the available studies on the molecular biological mechanisms of NFX in cancer and other diseases and it is recommended to translate the studies in experimental animals and cultured cells and repurpose NFX in various diseases for scientific evidence based on human studies.\nEuropean journal of pharmacology\n10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175776\n', {'citation_data': 'European journal of pharmacology\nAlthagafy, Hanan S\nEl-Aziz, MostafaK Abd\nIbrahim, Islam M\nAbd-Alhameed, Esraa K\nHassanein, EmadH M\nEuropean journal of pharmacology\n2023-May-14\n'}), ('Cancers\nMacrophages are a representative cell type in the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages that infiltrate the cancer microenvironment are referred to as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs exhibit protumor functions related to invasion, metastasis, and immunosuppression, and an increased density of TAMs is associated with a poor clinical course in many cancers. Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also known as osteopontin, is a multifunctional secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein. Although SPP1 is produced in a variety of organs, at the cellular level, it is expressed on only a few cell types, such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphoid cells, and mononuclear cells. SPP1 is also expressed by cancer cells, and previous studies have demonstrated correlations between levels of circulating SPP1 and/or increased SPP1 expression on tumor cells and poor prognosis in many types of cancer. We recently revealed that SPP1 expression on TAMs is correlated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in lung adenocarcinoma. In this review, we summarize the significance of TAMs in lung cancers and discuss the importance of SPP1 as a new marker for the protumor subpopulation of monocyte-derived TAMs in lung adenocarcinoma. Several studies have shown that the SPP1/CD44 axis contribute to cancer chemoresistance in solid cancers, so the SPP1/CD44 axis may represent one of the most critical mechanisms for cell-to-cell communication between cancer cells and TAMs.\nCancers\n10.3390/cancers15082250\n', {'citation_data': 'Cancers\nMatsubara, Eri\nYano, Hiromu\nPan, Cheng\nKomohara, Yoshihiro\nFujiwara, Yukio\nZhao, Shukang\nShinchi, Yusuke\nKurotaki, Daisuke\nSuzuki, Makoto\nCancers\n15\n8\n2023-Apr-12\n'}), ('Die Pharmazie\nGlioblastoma is a highly malignant and invasive brain tumor, and there is an urgent need to establish a treatment option that prevents its growth and metastasis.
