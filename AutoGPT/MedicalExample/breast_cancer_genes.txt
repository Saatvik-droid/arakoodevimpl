Summary of breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4: This gene produces a spliced long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis. It was originally identified in a screen for genes responsible for the development of resistance to anti-estrogens in breast cancer cells. It is thought that release of CCL21 enables this lncRNA to bind to the SNIP1 and PNUTS transcription factors, thereby activating a non-canonical GLI-dependent hedgehog signaling pathway that promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. A similar gene in cow expresses a protein in mature oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015].
